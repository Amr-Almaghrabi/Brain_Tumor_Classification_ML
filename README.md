#Brain Tumor Classification and Saliency Map Visualization
This project leverages deep learning for the classification of brain tumors from MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and no tumor. It includes a Streamlit-based web interface for image upload, model predictions, and visualization of saliency maps that highlight critical regions influencing the model's decisions. Key features of the project include:
Pre-Trained Models: Utilizes transfer learning with architectures like Xception and a custom CNN for accurate classification.
Saliency Maps: Generates and overlays saliency maps on MRI images to interpret model predictions, aiding in explainable AI.
Expert Explanations: Integrates a generative AI model to provide concise, expert-level explanations of saliency maps, simulating a neurologist's reasoning.
Streamlit Interface: User-friendly interface for uploading images, viewing predictions, and understanding model focus areas through visual explanations.
This project is particularly useful for medical imaging research, showcasing how deep learning can be applied to assist healthcare professionals with interpretable AI insights.
